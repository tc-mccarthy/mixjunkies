Easily redirect category links to a specific page, post, or even an outside url. 

== Description ==

Easily redirect category links to a specific page, post, or even an outside url. Redirects links like mysite.com/sony-tv/ to mysite.com/sony-tv-widescreen-model-1000/ or whatever post you want. Great for use with category menus. Themes like suffusion do not allow you to assign posts to a menu button and only allow categories, pages, and links but if you are like me and have a reason to use posts over pages you can create a category such as Sony TV and then assign it to the menu bar and without using this plugin if you click on that menu option it will display any posts that are in the Sony TV category even if its only one post and doesnt display the comments and other things that you may want your readers to take notice of. So if you use this plugin you can assign the full link of that post mysite.com/sony-tv-widescreen-model-1000/ to that category so that they are directed to the full post with comments and all without having to click on the title of that post or a link like "read more". 

Also helps with reducing duplicate content and helps prevent user frustration as well as speeds up the sites navigation capabilities.


== Installation ==

1. Login as an administrator to your WordPress Admin account. Using the "Add New" menu option under the "Plugins" section of the navigation, you can either search for: "category redirect to post or page" or if you've downloaded the plugin already, click the "Upload" link, find the .zip file you download and then click "Install Now". Or you can unzip and FTP upload the plugin to your plugins directory (wp-content/plugins/). 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Under you "Settings" in the admin panel you will see a new selection titled Category Redirect
4. Simple select edit under the category (or create a new one and come back then click edit on it)
5. Put a URL from either a post, a page, or even a external website in the empty field and click update options.
